# This will be a showcase of website templates.  They will be responsive to screen size and you will be able to scroll through them to find a template you like for your website. 

It will use placeholder text and images, and will be organized with mixins and variables so that seeing a specific template in a specifc color/font is easy.

The objective is to practise front end layout designs, and also offer creative inspiration for those who wish to use it.


### STEPS ###
#    Set Up React Application:
        Create a new React application using Create React App.

#    Create Components:
        Create separate components for the navigation bar and the hero section.
        For each component, create multiple templates (versions) that you can easily switch between.

    Navigation Between Templates:
        Implement navigation controls (e.g., buttons, swipe gestures) to switch between different templates for both the navigation bar and hero section.

    Customization and Styling:
        Style components using SCSS. Use placeholder images and Lorem Ipsum text.
        Utilize SCSS variables and mixins to make styling customization easier.

#    Homepage and Routing:
        Create a homepage (App.js) where the different combinations of navigation bar and hero templates can be previewed.
        Set up routing using React Router to navigate to specific pages (Nav and Hero) for each component.

    Connect Pages:
        On the Nav and Hero pages, display the selected templates for the navigation bar and hero section.
        Use React state or props to manage the currently selected templates.

    User Interaction:
        Implement user interactions to allow users to cycle through templates and choose their preferred combination.

    Testing and Deployment:
        Test application thoroughly to ensure that navigation and template switching work as expected.
        Deploy application to a hosting platform so that others can access it.
